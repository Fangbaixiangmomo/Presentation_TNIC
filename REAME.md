# Text-Based Network Industries and Endogenous Product Differentiation

This repository is a result of a presentation I did on the paper:
<a href="https://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/images/uploads/faculty/gordon-phillips/text-based-network-industries-endogenous-product-differentiation.pdf" style="text-decoration: underline;">Text-Based Network Industries and
Endogenous Product Differentiation</a> written by <a href="https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Gerard-Hoberg/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerard Hoberg</a> and <a href="https://tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/gordon-phillips" style="text-decoration: underline;">Gorden Philips</a>. I found the idea of Average Linkage Clustering and TNIC quite amusing so I created a visualization using Manim for that. You can find the script in the main folder and videos in the folder `media`. Enjoy!
